This program is meant to simulate diffusive particle transport through
networks described by mathematical graphs. Properties such as the 
discretization and the Laplacian matrix of the network need to be set in
the laplacian.inp file before running the code.


How to install:

1.If neccessary, change the variables at the top of the Makefile.
2.Run 'make' in your shell.

'make clean' will remove previous results and object-files from the
compilation which are no longer needed.
'make realclean' also removes the executable file.
